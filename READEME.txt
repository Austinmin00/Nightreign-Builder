Project Title: Nightreign Builder

Video Demo:

Description:
    - This application takes in csv files of user collected data and/or metadata to assist in making relic builds for the game.
        - You should be able to create and edit one build per session as a guest
        - Registered users get the additional feature of:
            - Custom Profile page
            - Save and edit many builds
            - Access to "news" page
        - The site will be managed to stay up to date on all patches and updates involving relics and characters
    - Users should have a fully modular experience:
        - Character selection
        - Chalice choice
        - Custom building every relic
        - Naming and describing each build saved
        - Access to character stat sheets and aggregated metadata
    - Security
        - Site will only ask for neccessary data 
        - Will avoid all third party association 
        - Will attempt to prevent and defend againsts leaks of user personal information
        - We expect the site to be void of anything not relating to relic building for Nightreign
