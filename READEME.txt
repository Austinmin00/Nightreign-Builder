NIGHTREIGN_BUILDER_WEB_APPLICATION:
    - This application takes in csv files of user collected data and/or metadata to assist in making relic builds for the game.
        - You should be able to create and edit one build per session as a guest
        - Registered users get the additional feature of:

            - Access to "news" page
        - The site will be managed to stay up to date on all patches and updates involving relics and characters
    - Users should have a fully modular experience:

        - Naming and describing each build saved
        - Access to character stat sheets and aggregated metadata
