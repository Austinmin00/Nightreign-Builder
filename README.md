# Project title: Nightreign Builder

#### Video Demo:

#### Description: Web application based on the popular game "Elden Ring: Nightreign" for users to create builds. A build is typically referring to the users preferred chalice and relics per chalice slot. Users will have access to every chalice in the game and their presets. Each chalice has six slots which users can fill in with relics of their own design or with in-game preset relics. Not all chalices are available to every character and the site handles that case. When a user saves their builds, all effects will aggregate to a table below the chalice and save button for display. The important part is the hidden values that the game doesn't offer. The tables main purpose is to display the metadata of the aggregated effects. This offers users better information and access to view builds that are usually under RNG circumstances. In turn this will enhance the overall gameplay experience on a mechanical and technical level. As more features are added and current features adjusted, I expect the site to be a foundation to the way the community operates in-game and out.
